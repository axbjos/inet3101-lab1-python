# INET 3101 Lab 1

The INET3101 Lab 1 but in Python.

Here is how a text/command-line menu system might be implemented in Python.

The goal with the labs is not just to implement the code in C, but to also get some insight in to the machine itself.

We will see that a compiled language like C needs to work with the operating system to dynamic manage memory use. This is complicated.

Interpreted languages, like Python, abstract this concept to make it easier for the programmer.
